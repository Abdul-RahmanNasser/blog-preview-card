- margin and padding properties
- width property with value is fit-content
- width and height properties is full screen
- line-height property
- box-shadow
- img element with width property with value 100%
- colors and background-color by using variables
- font-face

### What I learned

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  @font-face {
    font-family: name;
    src: url(extension);
  }
  element {
    font-family: name;
  }
  element {
    width: fit-content;
  }
}
```
### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on in responsive, flexbox, css framework, css grid.

### Useful resources

- [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/atrule_font-face.php) - This helped me for CSS @font-face rule. I really liked this web and will use it going forward.
- [normalize file](https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/) - This is an amazing web which helped me finally normalize my web. I'd recommend it to anyone still working as a front-end developer.
